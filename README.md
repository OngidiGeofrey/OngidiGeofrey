My name is Ongidi Geofrey. I am a result-driven Software developer.I aim to explore, build and practice building and manage world-class systems by creating functional, simple and attractive systems .

My excellent problem solving skills combined with a can-do attitude enables me to ensure the systemâ€™s performance, design, and user experience are up to the required standards.
